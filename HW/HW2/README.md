HW2 has 2 colab files for two parts of the homework, which are on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the Central Limit Theorem.
I did the homework by myself by following the instructions and examples in the homework, made by Prof. Bianco.
I also went to the TA Willow to ask some parts I was confused of: I wasn't sure what was meant by "most probable" in the
Maxwell-Boltzmann dist. homework, so she helped me understand the plot better. I also asked a bit of help on creating the Gaussian fit for the 
CLT homework, as at first I didn't really understand what the instructions were asking.
