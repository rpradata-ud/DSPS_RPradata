The HW3 colab file is in this folder (HW3), which is on the application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on earthquake data, following methods in [Corral, 2013]. There are 9 labelled figures and 2 labelled tables in the notebook. I worked in a team with Shar Daniels, Tali Natan, and Paula Galvez Molina. We all worked on our own homework notebooks, and asked each other if we needed help. I followed the team on reading in the data so that we all had similar datasets. In preparing the datetime column in the dataframe, our team had trouble with the date format so that we could convert the column to datetime objects, so Sid helped us with that. In selecting the valuable data for the stationary periods, Paula helped explain to me the concept of broadcasting so that I understood it better. In Figure 2 of the data exploration section, we decided to do the time gap histogram in minutes instead of nanoseconds so that we could read the resulting plots better. Finally, in plotting the CDF of each magnitude dataset in Figure 3, I initially had trouble getting the right graphs as I was using sp.stat.norm.cdf(). Then, Shar and Tali suggested I didn't need to use that, and instead use np.histogram(), extracted the histogram values, and use np.cumsum() to extract the resulting cdf (also with the help of Stack Overflow for this numpy function).
