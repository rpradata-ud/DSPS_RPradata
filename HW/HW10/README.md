This is the folder for HW10. I got an extension for this homework.

I spent quite a while understanding neural networks (and I'm still wrapping my head around it), and getting to familiarize myself with the processes. This homework shows an implementation of Neural Networks, the process of modifying/improving our NN model to gain more "accurate" predictions. Through this homework, I found that one of the most important way to assess how the model is doing, besides explicitly comparing it to the "real" data, is by looking at the loss function. When plotting the loss vs. the "epoch" (which in some way determines how we "fit" the neural network progress), we want the loss to (generally) be decreasing. The way I understand this is that we want to minimize our loss (optimize the model), so we see how the model is "learning" this way. 

In this HW particularly, we eventually implemented Physics-informed NN (PiNN), which is the neural network run with loss function and conditions based on physical knowledge/equations. Here, we were striving to predict values of velocity as a function of time and position, with respect to the Burger's equation. Even after implementing PiNN, we were still changing the epoch (increasing it) and the learning rate to better our model.
