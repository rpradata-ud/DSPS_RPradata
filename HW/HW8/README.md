The figure above is from Kaib & Volk, 2022 (link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00010.pdf) It intends, for illustrative purposes, to show the distribution of particle semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination, from an Oort cloud formulation simulation after a 4Gyr evolution. The article describes that from the graphs, one can see that the scattered disk generally has perihelia between ~ 30-40 AU and inclination below ~ 45 degrees before semimajor axis ~ 10^3 AU. However, I think this is hard to eyeball from the graph because there are too many points overplotted, especially in the bottom panel (for inclination). Furthermore, it is hard to comprehend the distribution after ~ 10^3 because of this reason. Setting the “alpha” plotting parameter can help show the “thickness”/“density” of certain populated regions. One could also use a scatter contour or a density histogram to illustrate the distribution.
