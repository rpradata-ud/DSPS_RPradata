The figure above is from Kaib & Volk, 2022 (link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00010.pdf). It intends, for illustrative purposes, to show the distribution of particle semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination, from an Oort cloud formulation simulation after a 4Gyr evolution. The article describes that from the graphs, one can see that the scattered disk generally has perihelia between ~ 30-40 AU and inclination below ~ 45 degrees before semimajor axis ~ 10^3 AU. However, I think this is hard to eyeball from the graph because there are too many points overplotted, especially in the bottom panel (for inclination). Furthermore, it is hard to comprehend the distribution after ~ 10^3 because of this reason. Setting the “alpha” plotting parameter can help show the “thickness”/“density” of certain populated regions. One could also use a scatter contour or a density histogram to illustrate the distribution.

"Good" plot:

The figure above is from Sánchez-Sierras et al., 2023 (link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12933.pdf). It shows certain line profiles of certain epochs pertaining a black hole transient GRS 1915+105. I think this plot is good because it has a neat and readable layout. The left and right sides are clearly seperated as the different Epochs, and horizontally, one can see the line profiles for each corresponding epoch. The y-axes for both left and right sides follow the same scales, which makes it easier to compare line profiles between the 2 epochs. The figure also strives to make efficient use of vertical space by only showing the x-axis labels on the far bottom plots. This way, the figure can draw the vertical dashed lines (marking the velocities) through the 3 line profiles.
