# DSPS_RPradata

Hi! I am Rayta, a first year graduate student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy.

- I decided to take this class because I have always been interested in data science and machine learning, and I plan to implement these techniques in my research in space physics.
  Through this class, I hope to get a more solid grasp of this subject, as well as develop and strengthen my skills in data science - coding for physics.

- I hope to learn how to implement statistical methods of studying astronomical/physical data better to give more a more optimal analysis, and I would also like to learn more about machine learning.

- I believe I am very dedicated in matters that interest me and things that I really want to solve, and this has especially helped me move on further with coding and problem-solving in research.
